### Udacity Front End Web Developer MyReads Project
---

#### Overview

An original starter template was provided for the Udacity project regarding React Fundamentals. The goal of this template was to save time by providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that may be used, but without any of the React code that was needed to complete the project. The project asked to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.

The original Udacity instructions were provided in [README_PROJECT.md](README_PROJECT.md).

The functionality of the app, Rubic and general code approach can be found in [APPROACH.md](APPROACH.md).

#### Running the Site

To run the application, follow these steps:

* download the repository to your local machine
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
* open up localhost:3000 in your browser


#### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.


#### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
